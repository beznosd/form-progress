# form-progress
A form completion progress tool. Any progress, any design, just some attributes and you are ready to go!

## The work is going

**form-progress** now works with input type *text* and with *textarea*
The library is very unstable now and not tested yet. I am working on it. <br/>
Every day i am adding new features and fixing the buggs.

## Plan

I think in a week it will be ready to use in am most simple cases with simple forms. <br/>
Then i will create a page with examples <br/>
And after proper testing i will add it to `npm` and `bower`
