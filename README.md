# form-progress
A form completion progress plugin. Without any dependencies. Your progress and your design. Any limitations!<br/>
Just pass css selector of your form and progress element to a simple function and you are ready to go!

## The work is going

The plugin is very unstable now and not tested yet. I am working on it. <br/>
Every day i am adding new features and fixing the buggs.

## List of supported input types and form elements

* text
* email
* password
* number
* search
* color 
* date
* datetime-local
* month
* week
* time
* range 
* tel
* url
* textarea

## Plan

I think in a week it will be ready to use in most simple cases with simple forms. <br/>
Docs examples of usage will be added soon. <br>
After a proper testing i will *form-progress* to `npm` and `bower`
